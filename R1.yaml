# SEEDING MODE. Seeding refers to the release of floats simulating
# contaminants in the water. These floats move as passive tracers.
#
# There are two seeding modes allowed to the user: 
#
# 1. "Area" seeding, where the user selects one or more polygons (e.g.
# oyster beds). Floats are seeded following a uniform distribution 
# within the selected areas.
#
# 2. "Point" seeding, where the user just select the coordinates and 
# floats are seeded around the selected location.

seed: 'point'

# AREA FILE. If "area" seeding is selected, then read the polygons
# from this file, which can either be a shapefile of plain text file.

file: ''

# POINT SEEDING INFORMATION. There are the geographical coordinates
# and a radius [m] of uniform dispersion around the center to add some 
# uncertainty on the origin of contamination. Example for Galway Bay: 

lon: -2
lat: 43.5
radius: 10000

# SEEDING LEVEL. Seed either at the surface or at the bottom. 

level: 'surface'

# TIME INTERVAL. The time interval in which floats are released. 
# This interval is defined by a time and an uncertainty [h] before
# and after that time.

time: '2021-10-19 00:00:00'
uncertainty: 0

# DURATION OF THE RUN. This is the time span [h] of the run.

duration: 48

# TRACKING MODE. Either backward (-1) to retrieve the source of 
# contamination, or forward (+1) to determine where the contaminants
# move from the source.

mode: 1
